### Abstract

In recent years, the optimization and computational intelligence methods have achieved remarkable results in domains including robotics, games, circuit design, and large-scale scheduling engine. This workshop will bring together researchers working at the field of optimization, reinforcement learning, and evolutionary computation, and it will also cover the cutting-edge research both in academic and industrial communities. It aims to help interested researchers both inside and outside of the field gain a high-level view about the current state-of-the-art works and potential directions and applications for future.

### Attending the Workshop
The workshop will be hosted at Tactic C, Aloft Shanghai Zhangjiang Haike (上海张江海科雅乐轩酒店).
